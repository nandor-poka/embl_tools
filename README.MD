# EMBL Tools Jupyter Notebooks

Simple ui for EMBL webservices based on Jupyter Notebooks and ipywidgets.

## How to contribute

Use the `core/_template_ui.py` as starting point. Make a copy of it and extend it with widgets for the service you wish to provide UI for. The EMBL python client files reside in `embl_client`.
